#Synopsis

This project explores the special statistical challenges of elimination tournaments, specifically national high school Lincoln-Douglas debate circuit tournaments from the 2015-2016 season. 

#Motivation

The first author debated on the national circuit from 2014-2018 for Immaculate Heart High School. She reached late elimination rounds of many tournaments including Lexington, Berkeley, Stanford, and many more. She attended the Tournament of Champions her senior year. This project is based in the R programming language and aims to explore questions such as: Does gender affect the outcome of rounds? Does geography play a role in wins/losses? What consitutes an upset? Is there a so-called "shadow effect"?

#Graphs

Note: The red line represents females and the blue line represents males.

##MeanWinsVsSeed.png
The graph suggests women have worse seeding than men. The debate community has recognized a gender disparity. Fewer girls participate in debate and males tend to do better. This graph supports the gender disparity in debate, showing that men tend to have lower seeds, meaning they performed better in pre-elimination rounds. 

##SeedingGender.png
This density graph also suggests that men fare better with seeding

##SpeakerpointsGender.png
This graph is inconclusive because of the wide range of speakerpoints. Each tournament sums up the total number of speakerpoings minus the round with the highest speakerpoint and the round with the lowest speakerpoing. Some tournaments have 5 rounds, while others have 6 or 7 rounds. The range of rounds and thus total speakerpoings makes this graph inconclusive. 

##roundsWonGender.png
Female seems to have losing records and males seem to have winning records. This graphs supports the community's thoughts on the gender disparity in debate.
